# React Quiz App
This was created in the CFA bootcamp using React, Bootstrap and CSS. It is one of the first apps we created using React, taking advantage of props, state and context. Some basic rendering tests are included, however there were some issues testing state at which point we had to use the node module enzyme to do shallow rendering to allow use of the state in testing.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/abazilla/CFA-React-Quiz.git
